					One common flaw we've seen in many frameworks is a lack of support for
					truly responsive text. While elements on the page resize fluidly, text
					still resizes on a fixed basis. To ameliorate this problem, for text

					line-height to optimize readability for the user. Line length stays
					between 45-80 characters and line height scales to be larger on
					smaller screens. To see Flow Text in action, slowly resize your
